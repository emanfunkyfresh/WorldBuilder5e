Instead, at the start of each of the stirge's turns, the target loses 5 (1d4 + 3) hit points due to blood loss.\nThe stirge can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement. It does so after it drains 10 hit points of blood from the target or the target dies. A creature, including the target, can use its action to detach the stirge."
