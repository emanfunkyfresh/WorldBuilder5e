The darkmantle's speed also becomes 0, it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed, and it moves with the target.\nA creature can detach the darkmantle by making a successful DC 13 Strength check as an action.

If any of the darkness overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell creating the light is dispelled."
